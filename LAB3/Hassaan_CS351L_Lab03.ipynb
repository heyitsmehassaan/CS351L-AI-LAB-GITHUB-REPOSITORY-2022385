        "Courses as nodes: Each node in the graph represents a course.\n",
        "Edges represent conflicts: An edge between two courses means there are students enrolled in both, so these courses cannot be scheduled at the same time.\n",
        "Colors as time slots: Each color represents a unique time slot. Our goal is to assign each course to a time slot such that no two conflicting courses are assigned the same time slot.\n",
        "Modifications to the Code:\n",
        "Graph Construction: Instead of generating a random graph, the graph should represent the actual conflict between courses. We'll manually create a graph where edges represent conflicts between courses.\n",
        "Node Labels: Nodes will be labeled with course names instead of numbers.\n",
        "Color Representation: Colors will represent time slots, and they will be printed as \"Time Slot 1\", \"Time Slot 2\", etc.\n",
        "I'll walk through the changes required:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Graph Representation of Courses\n",
        "I will replace the random graph generation with a manually created graph representing courses with conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Heuristic Selection\n",
        "I'll allow the user to choose between Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) and Degree Heuristic. These heuristics help decide which course should be scheduled next"
